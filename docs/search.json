Some are paid but usually quite affordable.\n\n\nIf there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen.\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to show your appreciation with a donation you’re most welcome to do so here:\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to contribute paid and free books - see GitHub. or submit via the Google Form.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!\nOscar Baruffa, Mohit Sharma, Vebash Naidoo, Julia Silge, Erik Gahner Larsen, Nicole Radziwill, Nistara Randhawa, Antoine Fabri, Jon Calder, Mike Smith, Ben Bolker, Maëlle Salmon, Laura Ellis, Bryan Shalloway, Antonio Uzal, Louis Aslett, Lluís Revilla Sancho, Brendan Cullen, Rami Krispin, Michael Dorman, Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Eric Leung, Isabella Velásquez, Matt Roumaya, Legana Fingerhut, Robert D.

The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R.

One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.\nThis book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.\nLink: https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/"

Bayes Rules! empowers readers to weave Bayesian approaches into an everyday modern practice of statistics and data science.\nThe overall spirit is very applied: the book utilizes modern computing resources and a reproducible pipeline; the discussion emphasizes conceptual understanding; the material is motivated by data-driven inquiry; and the delivery blends traditional “content” with “activity”.\nLink: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/\n\n\n\n\nPaul Roback\nJulie Legler\n\nThis book is designed for undergraduate students who have successfully completed a multiple linear regression course, helping them develop an expanded modeling toolkit that includes non-normal responses and correlated structure. Even though there is no mathematical prerequisite, the authors still introduce fairly sophisticated topics such as likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping in an intuitive and applied manner. The case studies and exercises feature real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook comes from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects. Every chapter features a variety of conceptual exercises, guided exercises, and open-ended exercises using real data.

We offer a breadth first approach, where the fundamentals of probability and statistics can be taught in one semester. The statistical programming language R plays an essential role throughout the text through simulations, data wrangling, visualizations and statistical procedures. Data sets from a variety of sources, including many from recent, open source scientific articles, are used in examples and exercises. Demonstrations of important facts are given through simulations, with some formal mathematical proofs as well.\nThis book is an excellent choice for students studying data science, statistics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, science, business, or any field which requires the two semesters of calculus needed to read this book.\nLink: https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/preface.html\n\n\n\n\nKeith McNulty\n\nIt is the author’s firm belief that all people analytics professionals should have a strong understanding of regression models and how to implement and interpret them in practice, and the aim with this book is to provide those who need it with help in getting there.\nFor accompanying solutions to some of the questions: https://keithmcnulty.github.io/peopleanalytics-regression-book/solutions/\nLink: http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/index.html\n\n\n\n\nEmil Hvitfeldt\n\nThis book aims to be a complement to the 1st version An Introduction to Statistical Learning book with translations of the labs into using the tidymodels set of packages.\nThe labs will be mirrored quite closely to stay true to the original material.\nLink: https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html\n\n\n\n\nDavid Robinson\n\nLearn to use empirical Bayesian methods for estimating binomial proportions, through a series of examples drawn from baseball statistics. These methods are effective in estimating click-through rates on ads, success rates of experiments, and other examples common in modern data science. You’ll learn both the theory and the practice behind empirical Bayesian methods, including computing credible intervals, performing Bayesian A/B testing, and fitting mixture models. Each example comes with R code that can be used to analyze your own data.\nLink: https://drob.gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel\nJohanna Hardin\n\nWe hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.\n\nStatistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.\nYou don’t have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data.\nData are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the~world.\n\nLink: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/\n\n\n\n\nNick Huntington-Klein\nVolunteers\n\nIn short, LOST is a Rosetta Stone for statistical software.\nLOST is a publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software.\nEach page of the website contains a statistical technique — which may be an estimation method, a data manipulation or cleaning method, a method for presenting or visualizing results, or any of the other kinds of things that statistical software typically does.\nFor each of those techniques, the LOST page will contain code for performing that method in a variety of packages and languages. It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa?\nLink: https://lost-stats.github.io/\n\n\n\n\nMichael Clark\n\nMixed models are an extremely useful modeling tool for situations in which there is some dependency among observations in the data, where the correlation typically arises from the observations being clustered in some way.\nLink: https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/\n\n\n\n\nMichael Clark\n\nThis document provides ‘by-hand’ demonstrations of various models and algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of them by providing clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with other tools.\nThe code was collected over several years, so is not exactly consistent in style, but now has been cleaned up to make it more so. Within each demo, you will generally find some imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the old code that was the initial demonstration.\nLink: https://m-clark.github.io/models-by-example/\n\n\n\n\nEric D. Feigelson\nG. Jogesh Babu\n\nModern astronomical research is beset with a vast range of statistical challenges, ranging from reducing data from mega datasets to characterizing an amazing variety of variable celestial objects or testing astrophysical theory. Linking astronomy to the world of modern statistics, this volume is a unique resource, introducing astronomers to advanced statistics through ready-to-use code in the public-domain R statistical software environment. The book presents fundamental results of probability theory and statistical inference, before exploring several fields of applied statistics, such as data smoothing, regression, multivariate analysis and classification, treatment of non-detections, time series analysis, and spatial point processes. It applies the methods discussed to contemporary astronomical research datasets using the R statistical software, making it an invaluable resource for graduate students and researchers facing complex data analysis task.\nLink: https://www.cambridge.org/in/academic/subjects/physics/astronomy-general/modern-statistical-methods-astronomy-r-applications?format=AR\n\n\n\n\nMåns Thulin\n\nThis book covers the fundamentals of data science and statistics. The first half deals with the basics of R and R coding, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and more advandced programming. The second half deals with modern statistics (favouring permutation tests, the bootstrap and Bayesian methods over traditional asymptotic methods), regression models and predictive modelling. It also contains information about debugging and explanations of 25 commonly encountered error messages in R. In addition, there are 170 or so exercises with fully worked solutions.\nLink: http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/\nPhysical copy available: https://amzn.to/3RytIxc\n\n\n\n\nBruce Dudek\n\nThis document can be a standalone “how-to” document for R users. However, it is primarily intended for students in the APSY510/511 statistics sequence at the University at Albany. It is a fairly thorough treatment of graphical and inferential evaluation of one-factor designs. It presumes prior background coverage of the ANOVA logic from standard textbooks such as Howell or Maxwell, Delaney and Kelley (2017). The analyses are intended to parallel and exhaust the methods already covered with SPSS, and to extend them to additional topics.\nLink: https://bcdudek.net/anova/oneway_anova_basics.pdf\n\n\n\n\nDavid Diez\nMine Cetinkaya-Rundel\nChristopher Barr\nOpenIntro\n\nA complete foundation for Statistics, also serving as a foundation for Data Science.\nLeanpub revenue supports OpenIntro (US-based nonprofit) so we can provide free desk copies to teachers interested in using OpenIntro Statistics in the classroom and expand the project to support free textbooks in other subjects.\nMore resources: openintro.org.\nPaid: Pay what you want for the ebook, minimum $0.00, however if you are able to, please consider the cause above.

The R package is intended to be utilized for prospective (a priori) power analysis. Calculating post hoc power is not a useful thing to do for single studies.\nThis package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R (2020). However, we have created two Shiny apps (for the ANOVA_power & ANOVA_exact functions respectively) to help use Superpower if you are not familiar with R.

Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is a book about how to use regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. It focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques.

Wikle\nAndrew Zammit-Mangion\nNoel Cressie\n\nWe live in a complex world, and clever people are continually coming up with new ways to observe and record increasingly large parts of it so we can comprehend it better (warts and all!). We are squarely in the midst of a “big data” era, and it seems that every day new methodologies and algorithms emerge that are designed to deal with the ever-increasing size of these data streams. It so happens that the “big data” available to us are often spatio-temporal data. That is, they can be indexed by spatial locations and time stamps. This book provides an accessible introduction, with hands-on applications of the methods through the use of R Labs at the end of each chapter.\nLink: https://spacetimewithr.org/\n\n\n\nA Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan\nStatistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data.

The area of disease mapping focusses on these problems, and the Bayesian paradigm has a major role to play in the understanding of the complex interplay of context and individual predisposition in such studies of disease. Using R for Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Health Modeling provides a major resource for those interested in applying Bayesian methodology in small area health data studies.\nLink: https://www.routledge.com/Using-R-for-Bayesian-Spatial-and-Spatio-Temporal-Health-Modeling/Lawson/p/book/9780367490126"

Aragón\n\nThis book is divided into two parts. First, I cover how to process, manipulate, and operate on data in R. Second, I cover basic PHDS from an epidemiologic perspective. Data science is “the art and science of transforming data into actionable knowledge.” Here is where we can build on the strengths of epidemiology (descriptive and analytic studies). However, in public health practice we need much more than this.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/medepi/phds/\n\n\n\n\nKonstantinos I. Bougioukas, PhD\n\nThe textbook can be used as support material for practical labs on basic statistics in medicine using R. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching for students and researchers in biomedical field. Additionally, it may be useful for (under)graduate students with a science background (engineering, mathematics) who wants to move towards biomedical sciences.\nLink: https://practical-stats-med-r.netlify.app/\n\n\n\n\nNathan Whitmore\n\nThis book is aimed at conservation and development practitioners who need to learn and use R in a part-time professional context. It gives people with a non-technical background a set of skills to graph, map, and model in R. It also provides background on data integration in project management and covers fundamental statistical concepts. The book aims to demystify R and give practitioners the confidence to use it.\nKey Features:\n• Viewing data science as part of a greater knowledge and decision making system • Foundation sections on inference, evidence, and data integration • Plain English explanations of R functions • Relatable examples which are typical of activities undertaken by conservation and development organisations in the developing world • Worked examples showing how data analysis can be incorporated into project reports\nLink: https://www.routledge.com/R-for-Conservation-and-Development-Projects-A-Primer-for-Practitioners/Whitmore/p/book/9780367205485\n\n\n\n\nEwen Harrison\nRiinu Pius\n\nIn this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/\n\n\n\n\nEpiR authors\n\nThis handbook is produced by a collaboration of epidemiologists from around the world drawing upon experience with organizations including local, state, provincial, and national health agencies, the World Health Organization (WHO), Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors without Borders (MSF), hospital systems, and academic institutions. Also check out the accompanying tutorials: https://appliedepi.org/tutorial/\nWritten by epidemiologists, for epidemiologists.\nLink: https://epirhandbook.com/\n\n\n\n\nPeter D.R. Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc\n\nThis is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/\n\n\n\n\nCarl Smith\nAntonio Uzal\nMark Warren\n\nA practical handbook to introduce data analysis and model fitting using R to ecologists and conservation biologists.

Lawson\n\nProgressively more and more attention has been paid to how location affects health outcomes. The area of disease mapping focusses on these problems, and the Bayesian paradigm has a major role to play in the understanding of the complex interplay of context and individual predisposition in such studies of disease. Using R for Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Health Modeling provides a major resource for those interested in applying Bayesian methodology in small area health data studies.\nLink: https://www.routledge.com/Using-R-for-Bayesian-Spatial-and-Spatio-Temporal-Health-Modeling/Lawson/p/book/9780367490126\n\n\n\n\nBrendan Ansell\n\nA complete beginner’s introduction to tidy R for data transformation, visualization and analysis automation — with applications in experimental biology.\nThis book is based on a short course developed for biomedical scientists at the WEHI Medical Research Institute. The content is designed to make learners comfortable with using R for exploratory analysis of large data sets, but does not cover statistics. The material and teaching examples draw on popular (non-biological) data sets, as well as gene expression and drug screening data types.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/ansellbr/WEHI_tidyR_course_book/"

    "text": "Ewen Harrison\nRiinu Pius\n\nIn this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/"

This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role.

The book’s easy-to-read approach helps students with little or no background in statistics or programming to develop real-world R skills through straightforward coverage of R objects and functions. Focusing on real-world data, the challenges of dataset construction, and the use of R’s powerful graphing tools, the guide is written in an accessible and sympathetic style that ensures students acquire functional R skills they can use in their own projects and carry into their work beyond the classroom.

We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of R’s capabilities.

Wendy Huynh\n\nHello! My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.\nMany fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/\n\n\n\n\nRobert I.

We will also cover how non-tidy data can be transformed to tidy data, the data science project life cycle, and the ecosystem of Tidyverse R packages that can be used to execute a data science project.\nBook format https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/\nEbook: https://leanpub.com/tidyverseskillsdatascience\nCourse format https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tidyverse-data-science-r\nLink: https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/\n\n\n\n\nTidyverse team\n\nThe goal of this book is to help you write better R code. It has four main components:\n\nDesign problems which lead to suboptimal outcomes.\nUseful patterns that help solve common problems.\nKey principles that help you balance conflicting patterns.\nSelected case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit together with real code.\n\nIt is used by the tidyverse team to promote consistency across packages in the core tidyverse.\nLink: https://design.tidyverse.org/\n\n\n\n\nJenny Bryan\nJim Hester\n\nThe initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The target learner:\nHas a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.Is largely self-taught.Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow them down or make their work products more brittle.Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and more self-sufficient.\nLink: https://rstats.wtf/\n\n\n\n\nR Core\n\nThis is a guide to extending R, describing the process of creating R add-on packages, writing R documentation, R’s system and foreign language interfaces, and the R API.\nThis manual is for R, version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28).\nLink: https://colinfay.me/writing-r-extensions/index.html\n\n\n\n\nNathaniel D. Phillips\n\nLearn R from the ground up.\nLet me make something very, very clear…\nI did not write this book.\nThis whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/\n\n\n\n\nJenny Bryan\n\nLearn how to: Explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data, make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable, using R. This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis except for statistical modelling and inference.\nLink: https://stat545.com/"

The book is structured around critical R tasks, and focuses on applied knowledge, rather than abstract concepts. The book’s easy-to-read approach helps students with little or no background in statistics or programming to develop real-world R skills through straightforward coverage of R objects and functions. Focusing on real-world data, the challenges of dataset construction, and the use of R’s powerful graphing tools, the guide is written in an accessible and sympathetic style that ensures students acquire functional R skills they can use in their own projects and carry into their work beyond the classroom. A Survivor’s Guide to R focusses on the challenges of learning R, rather than learning statistics.

Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third.

The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.\nWe acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.\nThis book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills.

Some example chapters include, A/B testing to make perfect lemonade, word vectors to improve your resume, differential equations for weight loss, and how a man used statistics to qualify for the Olympics. Life is full of decisions. We, as people, have the remarkable ability to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. We, as humans, have only recently developed the ability to use computers to process vast amounts of data to improve our decision making. This innovation has led to the development of the field of Data Science. This book is written to give tools and inspiration to aspiring decision makers. You make decisions daily and the methodology of data science can help.\nLink: https://gumroad.com/l/everydaydata"

Horton\n\nThis book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and “think with data” (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.\nWe acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.\nThis book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.\nLink: https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/"

Sin embargo, el mundo de la ciencia de datos es cualquier cosa menos sencillo. En él, cualquier ayuda, cualquier guía es bienvenida. Por ello, es muy recomendable que la persona que se quiera introducir en él, sea con fines de investigación o con fines profesionales, se agarre de la mano de un guía especializado que le lleve, de una manera amena, comprensible y eficiente, desde el planteamiento de su problema y la captura de la información necesaria para poderle dar una solución hasta la redacción de las conclusiones finales que ha obtenido con los modernos informes reproducibles colaborativos. Y como en la parte central de ese camino tendrá que luchar con grandes gigantes (en la actualidad denominados técnicas estadísticas y algoritmos), el guía tendrá que explicarle, de modo sencillo y ágil, en qué consiste la lucha (las técnicas y los algoritmos) y cómo llegar a la victoria lo más rápido posible, enseñándole a moverse por el mundo del software estadístico, en nuestro caso R, que le permitirá realizar los cálculos necesarios para vencer al problema planteado a una velocidad vertiginosa.\nLink: https://cdr-book.github.io/index.html\n\n\n\n\nOswaldo Bello\n\nEste libro es una guía para la enseñanza de la asignatura Probabilidad, esencialmente pretende ser un curso de Probabilidades Discretas aplicado con el lenguaje de programación R.\nLink: https://oswaldobelloc.github.io/probabilidades/\n\n\n\n\nNicolás Sacco\nJosé Rodríguez de la Fuente\nSofia Jaime\n\nLa literatura sobre las clases sociales en Argentina posee ya una larga tradición y una amplia gama de abordajes. La relevancia de este tema reside en las transformaciones recientes de la estructura social, pero también, en los desafíos, tanto teóricos como metodológicos, que el tema posee. Estudiantes, investigadores y profesionales, en fin, aquellos interesados en su estudio, se encuentran de forma frecuente con la paralizante tarea de afrontar la infinita literatura y discusión teórica sobre la cuestión, la construcción de información, o bien con el oscuro privilegio de acceso a ciertas bases de datos, en el caso de los estudios con datos cuantitativos secundarios; en definitiva, en la posibilidad de caer en las trampas de la ciencia cerrada o no-reproducible, todavía bastante frecuente.\nLink: https://nsacco.github.io/clases-arg/index.html\n\n\n\n\nGarrett Grolemund\n\nEste es el sitio web para la versión en español de “Hands-On Programming with R” (en lo adelante “Programación Práctica con R”) de Garrett Grolemund. Este libro le enseñará cómo programar en R, con ejemplos prácticos. Fue escrito para personas que no son programadores con el objetivo de proporcionar una introducción amigable al lenguaje R. Aprenderá a cargar datos, ensamblar y desensamblar objetos de datos, navegar por el sistema de entorno de R, escribir sus propias funciones y utilizar todas las herramientas de programación de R. A lo largo del libro, utilizará sus nuevas habilidades para resolver problemas prácticos de ciencia de datos.\nLink: https://davidrsch.github.io/hopres/\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham\nGarrett Grolemund\n\nEste es el sitio web de la versión en español de “R for Data Science”, de Hadley Wickham y Garrett Grolemund.

    "text": "coordinado por Gema Fernández-Avilés\nJosé-María Montero\n\nCon la emergencia de la nueva sociedad, en la que el manejo de la ingente cantidad de información que genera se hace absolutamente necesario para circular por ella, la ciencia de datos ha venido para quedarse. Sin embargo, el mundo de la ciencia de datos es cualquier cosa menos sencillo. En él, cualquier ayuda, cualquier guía es bienvenida. Por ello, es muy recomendable que la persona que se quiera introducir en él, sea con fines de investigación o con fines profesionales, se agarre de la mano de un guía especializado que le lleve, de una manera amena, comprensible y eficiente, desde el planteamiento de su problema y la captura de la información necesaria para poderle dar una solución hasta la redacción de las conclusiones finales que ha obtenido con los modernos informes reproducibles colaborativos. Y como en la parte central de ese camino tendrá que luchar con grandes gigantes (en la actualidad denominados técnicas estadísticas y algoritmos), el guía tendrá que explicarle, de modo sencillo y ágil, en qué consiste la lucha (las técnicas y los algoritmos) y cómo llegar a la victoria lo más rápido posible, enseñándole a moverse por el mundo del software estadístico, en nuestro caso R, que le permitirá realizar los cálculos necesarios para vencer al problema planteado a una velocidad vertiginosa.\nLink: https://cdr-book.github.io/index.html"

Estudiantes, investigadores y profesionales, en fin, aquellos interesados en su estudio, se encuentran de forma frecuente con la paralizante tarea de afrontar la infinita literatura y discusión teórica sobre la cuestión, la construcción de información, o bien con el oscuro privilegio de acceso a ciertas bases de datos, en el caso de los estudios con datos cuantitativos secundarios; en definitiva, en la posibilidad de caer en las trampas de la ciencia cerrada o no-reproducible, todavía bastante frecuente.\nLink: https://nsacco.github.io/clases-arg/index.html"

This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.\nIntermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.\nLink: https://www.r4wrds.com/\n\n\n\n\nMichael Freeman\nJoel Ross\n\nThis book covers the foundation skills necessary to start writing computer programs to work with data using modern and reproducible techniques.

This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.\nIntermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.\nLink: https://www.r4wrds.com/"

It establishes a foundation on which you can build and share knowledge, based on data, about an aspect of the world of interest to you.\nIn this book we explore, prod, push, manipulate, knead, and ultimately, try to understand the implications of, data. The motto of the university from which I took my PhD is ‘Naturam primum cognoscere rerum’ or roughly ‘first to learn the nature of things,’ and we will indeed attempt to do that. But the original quote continues ‘temporis aeterni quoniam,’ or roughly ‘for eternal time,’ and it is tools, approaches, and workflows that enable you to establish lasting knowledge that I focus on in this book.\nLink: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/"

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.\nLink: https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/\n\n\n\n\nCrystal Lewis\n\nThis book begins, like many other books in this subject area, by describing the research life cycle and how data management fits within the larger picture. The remaining chapters are then organized by each phase of the life cycle, with examples of best practices provided for each phase. Considerations on whether you should implement, and how to integrate those practices into your workflow will be discussed.\nLink: https://datamgmtinedresearch.com/index.html\n\n\n\n\nChris Brown\nMurray Cadzow\nPaula A Martinez\nRhydwyn McGuire\nDavid Neuzerling\nDavid Wilkinson, Saras Windecker\n\nGitHub actions allow us to trigger automated steps after we launch GitHub interactions such as when we push, pull, submit a pull request, or write an issue.\nLink: https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/\n\n\n\n\nDavid Keyes\n\nThere are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\nThings like:\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\nLink: https://howiuser.com/\n\n\n\n\nFrank E Harrell Jr\n\nThis work is intended to foster best practices in reproducible data documentation and manipulation, statistical analysis, graphics, and reporting.

Readers are also guided in choosing statistically efficient descriptive analyses that are consonant with the type of data being analyzed.\nLink: http://hbiostat.org/rflow/\n\n\n\n\nDavid Keyes\n\nR for the Rest of Us will show ways that R can be used beyond complex statistical analysis.

This code has to be reproducible, documented and production ready. Not my original idea, but introduced by the UK’s Analysis Function.\nThe basic idea of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) is to have code that always produces the same result when run, whatever this result might be.

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.\nLink: https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/"

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\nThings like:\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\nLink: https://howiuser.com/"

Imagine, further, that researchers and decision-makers acting in the public interest had tools enabling them to test and model such data to explore different scenarios of the future. People would be able to make more informed decisions, based on the best available evidence. In this technocratic dreamland pressing problems such as climate change, inequality and poor human health could be solved.\nThese are the types of real-world issues that we hope the methods in this book will help to address. Spatial microsimulation can provide new insights into complex problems and, ultimately, lead to better decision-making.
