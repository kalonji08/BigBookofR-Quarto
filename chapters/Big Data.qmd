## Big Data with R - Exercise book

- [James Blair](https://twitter.com/Blair09M)

This 2-day workshop covers how to analyze large amounts of data in R. We will focus on scaling up our analyses using the same dplyr verbs that we use in our everyday work. We will use dplyr with data.table, databases, and Spark. We will also cover best practices on visualizing, modeling, and sharing against these data sources. Where applicable, we will review recommended connection settings, security best practices, and deployment options.

Working with BIG DATA requires a particular suite of data analytics tools and advanced techniques, such as machine learning (ML). Many of these tools are readily and freely available in R. This full-day session will provide participants with a hands-on training on how to use data analytics tools and machine learning methods available in R to explore, visualize, and model big data.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the arrow R package to create seamless engineering-to-analysis data pipelines. You’ll learn how to use interoperable data file formats like Parquet or Feather for efficient storage and data access. You’ll learn how to exercise fine control over data types to avoid common data pipeline problems. During the tutorial you’ll be processing larger-than-memory files and multi-file datasets with familiar dplyr syntax, and working with data in cloud storage.
