## Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps

- Colin Fay
- Sébastien Rochette
- Vincent Guyader
- Cervan Girard

This book will not get you started with Shiny, nor talk how to work with
Shiny once it is sent to production. What we'll see is the process of
building an application that will later be sent to production.

## Mastering Shiny

This book complements Shiny's online documentation and is intended to
help app authors develop a deeper understanding of Shiny. After reading
this book, you'll be able to write apps that have more customized UI,
more maintainable code, and better performance and scalability.

## Mastering Shiny Solutions, Baek

- [Howard Baek](https://twitter.com/howard_baek)

Mastering Shiny Solutions 2021, by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti, was released in early 2021. Since then, there have been various changes to the exercises in Mastering Shiny, and this book serves as an updated version. A few solutions in this book defer to those provided in Mastering Shiny Solutions 2021. Also, some exercises don’t contain solutions, and for these exercises, the author writes, “Not sure.”

## R Shiny Applications in Finance, Medicine, Pharma and Education Industry

- Loan Robinson

The book is a guide to help you understand the codes of five applications you will receive after you purchase the book. If you can go through all of the codes, you can easily create a complex and brilliant R Shiny application.

Instead of spending hours and hours trying to understand, have the ideas, write the codes, apply application features, you can use the codes to quickly apply and learn the codes. There are many advanced features, it takes years to learn them, now you have it, hand on and work through it.

Paid: Online version is a sample of the book, full paid version and all code available for purchase $250

## Shiny App-Packages

- Martin Frigaard

This book is a resource to help ‘connect the dots’ between building scalable Shiny applications and writing R packages. Adopting R package development practices in the early stages of your Shiny app will improve the reusability, maintainability, and shareability of all your hard work.

## Shiny Production with AWS Book

- [Matt Doncho](https://twitter.com/mdancho84)

A big problem exists... No one teaches Data Scientists how to deploy web
applications. You spend all of this time building Shiny web
applications. And then... [silence].

This book alongside the Shiny Developer with AWS Course (DS4B 202A-R)
solves this problem - teaching Data Scientists how to deploy, host, and
maintain web applications.
