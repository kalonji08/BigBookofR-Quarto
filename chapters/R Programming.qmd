## A Survivor's Guide to R

- [Kurt Taylor Gaubatz](kktg.net)

A Survivor’s Guide to R provides a gentle yet thorough introduction to R. The book is structured around critical R tasks, and focuses on applied knowledge, rather than abstract concepts. The book's easy-to-read approach helps students with little or no background in statistics or programming to develop real-world R skills through straightforward coverage of R objects and functions. Focusing on real-world data, the challenges of dataset construction, and the use of R’s powerful graphing tools, the guide is written in an accessible and sympathetic style that ensures students acquire functional R skills they can use in their own projects and carry into their work beyond the classroom. A Survivor's Guide to R focusses on the challenges of learning R, rather than learning statistics.  This makes it an effective complement for those who are using other statistics texts, or who already have a statistics background.

## A sufficient Introduction to R

- Derek l. Sonderegger

This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to
programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I believe
that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn't
give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial
ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a
"crash-course" would.

## Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in R

- [Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund)

Learn how to write object-oriented programs in R and how to construct
classes and class hierarchies in the three object-oriented systems
available in R. This book gives an introduction to object-oriented
programming in the R programming language and shows you how to use and
apply R in an object-oriented manner. You will then be able to use this
powerful programming style in your own statistical programming projects
to write flexible and extendable software.

## Advanced R

- [Hadley Whickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)

This is the companion website for "Advanced R", a book in Chapman &
Hall's R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to
improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It
should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages,
as it explains some of R's quirks and shows how some parts that seem
horrible do have a positive side.

The book is free online. (Ignore the message redirecting you to the 2nd
edition, this is the latest edition)

## Advanced R Solutions

- Malte Grosser
- Henning Bumann
- Hadley Wickham

This book offers solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham's book
Advanced R (Edition 2). It is work in progress and under active
development. The 2nd edition of Advanced R has been published and we are
currently working towards completion.

## An Introduction to Data Analysis

- [Michael Franke](https://twitter.com/meanwhileina)

This book provides basic reading material for an introduction to data
analysis. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. After covering the
use of R for data wrangling and plotting, the book introduces key
concepts of data analysis from a Bayesian and a frequentist tradition.
This text is intended for use as a first introduction to statistics for
an audience with some affinity towards programming, but no prior
exposition to R.

## An Introduction to R

- [Alex Douglas](https://twitter.com/Scedacity)
- [Deon Roos](https://twitter.com/DeonRoos88)
- [Ana Couto](https://twitter.com/AnaSofiaCouto)
- [Francesca Mancini](https://twitter.com/frances_mancini)
- [David Lusseau](https://twitter.com/lusseau)

The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and
flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research.
R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new
language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little
steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of
this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal
experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is
not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would
be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory
statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to
highlight some of R's capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help
you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic
skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your
experience in using R.

## An(other) introduction to R

- [Felix Lennert](https://felix-lennert.netlify.app)

In the following, you will receive a gentle introduction to R and how you can use it to work with data. This tutorial was heavily inspired by Richard Cotton’s “Learning R” (Cotton 2013) and Hadley Wickham’s and Garrett Grolemund’s “R for Data Science” (abbreviated with R4DS).

## Another Book on Data Science  Learn R and Python in Parallel

- Nailong Zhang

There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data
Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are
great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together?

Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in
Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from
mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the
applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch,
such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula
simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression
(lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees,
etc.

## Best Coding Practices for R

- [Vikram Singh Rawat](https://twitter.com/Guru_GyanKhoji))

R is a huge language and I would like to share the little knowledge I have in the subject. I don’t claim to be an expert but this book will guide you in the right path wherever possible.

Most of the books about R programming language will tell you what are the possible ways to do one thing in R. This book will only tell you one way to do that thing correctly.

## Book of R A First Course in Programming and Statistics

- Tilman M. Davies

The Book of R is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to R, the world’s most popular programming language for statistical analysis. Even if you have no programming experience and little more than a grounding in the basics of mathematics, you’ll find everything you need to begin using R effectively for statistical analysis.

You’ll start with the basics, like how to handle data and write simple programs, before moving on to more advanced topics, like producing statistical summaries of your data and performing statistical tests and modeling. You’ll even learn how to create impressive data visualizations with R’s basic graphics tools and contributed packages, like ggplot2 and ggvis, as well as interactive 3D visualizations using the rgl package.

## Cookbook for R

- Winston Chang

The goal of the cookbook is to provide solutions to common tasks and
problems in analyzing data.

Not to be confused with R Cookbook

## Data Analytics with R A Recipe book

- [Ryan Garnett](https://twitter.com/ryangarnett78)

The structure and design of this book is based on iterative learning, starting with the most basic and build by adding one new element concept. the book has been structured to be small easily consumable chunks similar to that of a recipe card. The concept for a recipe card is that they are self contained, providing all the ingredients, preparation, and instructions required to create a meal. While a cookbook may consist of many recipes, there is no expectation to read, understand, and master all the recipes in order to prepare a meal. Following this as the central theme the book, it has been designed as a number of data analytics recipes focusing on the R language.

## Domain-Specific Languages in R

- [Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund)

Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R,
including coverage of regular expressions. This compact, in-depth book
shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a
particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages.
Along the way, you'll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise
way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context.

Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs including large
data sets or matrix multiplication; pattern matching DSLs for
application in computer vision; and DSLs for continuous time Markov
chains and their applications in data science. After reading and using
this book, you'll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you
can extrapolate to other programming languages.

## Efficient R programming

- [Colin Gillespie](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/)
- [Robin Lovelace](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace)

This book is for anyone who wants to make their R code faster to type,
faster to run and more scalable. These considerations generally come
after learning the very basics of R for data analysis.

## Field Guide to the R Ecosystem

- Mark Sellors

This field guide aims to introduce the reader to the main components of
the R ecosystem that may be encountered in "the field".Whatever the
reason, whilst there is a wealth of in-depth information for people
actually using the language, I could find precious little information
that provided the sort of overview of the ecosystem that I know I'd have
appreciated when I first came to the language. And with that thought, a
field guide is born...

## Functional Data Structures in R

- [Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund)

Get an introduction to functional data structures using R and write more
effective code and gain performance for your programs. This book teaches
you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for
example you'll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying
environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement
traditional data structures. You'll also see how, by abandoning
traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building
new versions rather than modifying them. You'll discover how these
so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional
data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do
serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.

- Joanna Chimiak-Opoka
- Thorsten Simon
- Achim Zeileis

A learning resource for programming novices who want to learn
programming using the statistical programming language R. While one of
the major strengths of R is the broad variety of packages for statistics
and data science, this resource focuses on learning and understanding
basic programming concepts using base R. Only a couple of additional
packages are used and/or briefly discussed for special tasks.

This online book is specifically written for participants of the course
"Introduction to Programming: Programming in R" offered by the Digital
Science Center at Universität Innsbruck.

## Introduction to R - R spatial

- R Spatial

This document provides a concise introduction to R. It emphasizes what
you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is
no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R
language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer
programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you
did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material
may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R
much, or if you feel confused.

## Modern R with the tidyverse

- Bruno Rodrigues

This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R
in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book.
Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to
Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be
harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate
to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can
start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not
functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the
{tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can
start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and
functional programming, you might still be interested in this book,
especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and
further advanced topics respectively.

## R for Graduate Students

- Y. Wendy Huynh

Hello! My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.

Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.

Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.

## Rcpp for everyone

- Masaki E. Tsuda

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It
is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is
implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And
Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can
get high performance outcome.

This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who
are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of
Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint
of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.

## The R Inferno

- Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for
many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise
report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This
book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are
familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time
spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise
book, 126 pages only.

Book and Course formats

This course introduces a powerful set of data science tools known as the
Tidyverse. The Tidyverse has revolutionized the way in which data
scientists do almost every aspect of their job. We will cover the simple
idea of "tidy data" and how this idea serves to organize data for
analysis and modeling. We will also cover how non-tidy data can be
transformed to tidy data, the data science project life cycle, and the
ecosystem of Tidyverse R packages that can be used to execute a data
science project.

The goal of this book is to help you write better R code. It has four
main components:

1.  Design problems which lead to suboptimal outcomes.

2.  Useful patterns that help solve common problems.

3.  Key principles that help you balance conflicting patterns.

4.  Selected case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit
    together with real code.

It is used by the tidyverse team to promote consistency across packages
in the core tidyverse.

## What They Forgot to Teach You About R

- Jenny Bryan
- Jim Hester

The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on
workshop. The target learner:

Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.Is largely
self-taught.Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits
that may slow them down or make their work products more brittle.Is
interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and
more self-sufficient.

## YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R

- Nathaniel D. Phillips

Learn R from the ground up.

Let me make something very, very clear...

I did not write this book.

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late
night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking
out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient
usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I
brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found
a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching
several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin
translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be
an introduction to R called The Pirate's Guide to R.
