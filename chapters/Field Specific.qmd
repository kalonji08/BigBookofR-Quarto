## An Open-Source Active Learning Curriculum for Data Science in Engineering

- [Zachary del Rosario](www.zdelrosario.com)

This work provides open-source content for an active learning curriculum in data science. The scope of the content is sufficient for a full-semester introduction to scientifically reproducible statistical computation, data wrangling, visualization, basic statistical literacy, and data-driven modeling. The content is broken into short exercises that introduce new concepts, and longer challenges that encourage students to develop those skills in an open-ended context.

## Computing Matrix Algebra

- [Mario De Toma](https://twitter.com/mariodetoma)

"Nobody can be a poet without feeling strong affection for words, at the same
time nobody can be serious about data science without becoming close friend
to matrices."

This book is actually a cheat sheet about computing matrix algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, inversion and factorization.

It is written foR (aspiring) data scientists where with "foR" (capital letter R) I mean the side of data science addicted to R and its gorgeous ecosystem especially including Rcpp, RcppArmadillo and RcppEigen.

## Crime by the Numbers A Criminologist’s Guide to R

- [Jacob Kaplan](https://twitter.com/JacobKaplanCrim)

This book introduces the programming language R and is meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets.

Dear Data Scientists, Educators, and Data Scientists who are Educators:

This book is a warm welcome and an invitation. If you're a data
scientist in education or an educator in data science, your role isn't
exactly straightforward. This book is our contribution to a growing
movement to merge the paths of data analysis and education. We wrote
this book to make your first step on that path a little clearer and a
little less scary.

## Hierarchical Compartmental Reserving Models

- [Markus Gesmann](https://magesblog.com)
- Jake Morris

Hierarchical compartmental reserving models provide a parametric framework for describing aggregate insurance claims processes using differential equations. We discuss how these models can be specified in a fully Bayesian modeling framework to jointly fit paid and outstanding claims development data, taking into account the random nature of claims and underlying latent process parameters. We demonstrate how modelers can utilize their expertise to describe specific development features and incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimation. We also explore the subtle yet important difference between modeling incremental and cumulative claims payments. Finally, we discuss parameter variation across multiple dimensions and introduce an approach to incorporate market cycle data such as rate changes into the modeling process. Examples and case studies are shown using the probabilistic programming language Stan via the brms package in R.

## How to be a modern scientist

- [Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)

A book about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way. The face
of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or
perish. We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt
Metrics are regular parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high
level advice about which tools to use, how to use them, and what to look
out for. This book is appropriate for scientists at all levels who want
to stay on top of the current technological developments affecting
modern scientific careers.

## Introduction to Econometrics with R

- Christoph Hanck
- Martin Arnold
- Alexander Gerber
- Martin Schmelzer

Beginners with little background in statistics and econometrics often have a hard time understanding the benefits of having programming skills for learning and applying Econometrics. Introduction to Econometrics with R is an interactive companion to the well-received textbook Introduction to Econometrics by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson (2015). It gives a gentle introduction to the essentials of R programming and guides students in implementing the empirical applications presented throughout the textbook using the newly acquired skills. This is supported by interactive programming exercises and integration of interactive visualizations of central concepts which are based on the flexible JavaScript library D3.js.

## R for Water Resources Data Science

- [Ryan Peek](https://ryanpeek.org/)
- [Rich Pauloo](https://www.richpauloo.com/)

Consists of 2 courses

Introductory: 
This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who work with data, from analysts and program staff to engineers and scientists. This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.

Intermediate:
In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.

This course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.
