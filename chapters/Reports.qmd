## R bookdownplus Textbook

- Peng Zhao

‘bookdownplus’ is an extension of ‘bookdown’. It is a collection of multiple templates, which I have been collecting since years ago on the basis of LaTeX, and have been tailoring them so that I can work happily under the umbrella of ‘bookdown’. ‘bookdownplus’ helps you (and me) write varied types of books and documents. This book you are reading at the moment was exactly produced by ‘bookdownplus’.
