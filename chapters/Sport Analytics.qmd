## Basketball Data Science with Applications in R

- Paola Zuccolotto
- Marica Manisera

Using data from one season of NBA games, Basketball Data Science: With Applications in R is the perfect book for anyone interested in learning and applying data analytics in basketball. Whether assessing the spatial performance of an NBA player's shots or doing an analysis of the impact of high pressure game situations on the probability of scoring, this
book discusses a variety of case studies and hands-on examples using a custom R package. The codes are supplied so readers can reproduce the analyses themselves or create their own. Assuming a basic statistical knowledge, Basketball Data Science with R is suitable for students, technicians, coaches, data analysts and applied researchers.

## Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics

- [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)

Learn to use empirical Bayesian methods for estimating binomial proportions, through a series of examples drawn from baseball statistics. These methods are effective in estimating click-through rates on ads, success rates of experiments, and other examples common in modern data science. You'll learn both the theory and the practice behind empirical Bayesian methods, including computing credible intervals, performing Bayesian A/B testing, and fitting mixture models. Each example comes with R code that can be used to analyze your own data.
