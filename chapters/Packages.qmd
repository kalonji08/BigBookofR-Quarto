## Rcpp for everyone

- Masaki E. Tsuda

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It
is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is
implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And
Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can
get high performance outcome.

This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who
are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of
Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint
of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.

compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2
powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you
can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.
